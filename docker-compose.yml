# The command is translated to this docker compose for convenience

# Some docker commands
# Spin up container with:     docker compose up -d
# Take down container with:   docker compose down | exit if container terminal is attached
# Use container's terminal via any of the following:
#   - vscode, new terminal:   docker attach pw-cont
#   - through docker desktop: requires running 'bash' so arrow keys can be used
